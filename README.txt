Convert classic content to blocks. An extremely useful tool when upgrading to the WordPress 5+ Gutenberg editor.

== Description ==

The Bulk Block Converter plugin scans all posts and pages for classic content. Then, provides options to individually or bulk convert all the content within 'Classic' blocks to individual blocks. This is an extremely useful tool when migrating a site from the WordPress Classic Editor to the new WordPress 5+ Gutenberg Editor.

After upgrading to WordPress 5, all post and page content previously created using the Classic Editor will be contained within the 'Classic' block. Typically, in order to convert the content within the 'Classic' block to individual blocks, you must edit each post or page individually. Then, click the 'Convert to Blocks' option for the 'Classic' block. If you have a significant number of posts or pages, this can be a very long and tedious process. The Bulk Block Converter plugin was created to drastically reduce the time it takes to convert classic content to Gutenberg blocks.

Please Note: The block conversion process is irreversible. So, be sure to backup your site before converting your content to blocks.
